# The Turing Bistro of Software and Design

This repository is an exercise in HTML and CSS.

## Contraints

* You can't change any of the HTML markup
* You can't use JavaScript

## Challenges

In addition to generally making the page look good, try some of the following:

* Remove the underline from the hyperlinks
* Change the style of the hyperlinks when a mouse hovers over them
* Make the items in the navigation align horizontally
* Style the menu items like a traditional menu you'd find at a restaurant
* Float the Turing Logo to either the left or the right
* Move the announcements to a side bar
* Prefix each of the menu prices with a dollar sign ($)
* Gradually transition the color of a hyperlink when a mouse hovers over it
