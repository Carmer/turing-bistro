You have two constraints:

### Beginning

* Center the container
* Remove the underline from the hyperlinks
* Change the style of the hyperlinks when a mouse hovers over them
* Prefix each of the menu prices with a dollar sign ($)

### Intermediate

* Make the items in the navigation align horizontally
* Style the menu items like a traditional menu you'd find at a restaurant
* Float the Turing Logo to either the left or the right

### Challenging

* Move the announcements to a side bar
* Gradually transition the color of a hyperlink when a mouse hovers over it
* Make the page responsive to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
